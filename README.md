# Hi There, I'm Guilherme Silva 👋

My name is Guilherme Silva from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2013 and currently I'm developer at [Evolution Informatica](https://evolutioninformatica.com.br). I'm passionate about open source projects, so I've created some projects as [SevenFlix](https://github.com/slayonthunder/sevenflix/tree/master/seven-flix) and I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my career.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵).
- 🔭 I’m currently working as a front end developer [@Evolution](https://evolutioninformatica.com.br/)
- 🌱 I’m learning about React JS, React-Native and JavaScrip.
Would you like to find me?
