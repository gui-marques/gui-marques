# Hi There, I'm Guilherme Silva 👋

🚀 About me

My name is Guilherme Silva from Brazil (🇧🇷). I have worked as a Front-End Developer since 2013 and am currently a Systems Analyst. I'm passionate about open source projects, that's why I created some projects like [SevenFlix](https://github.com/slayonthunder/sevenflix/tree/master/seven-flix) and I've always loved producing a lot of content during my career.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) football (⚽️), watch films (🎞️) and series (📺), read books (📚), listen to music (🎵).

🔭 I am currently working as a Protheus Systems Analyst at [ATI Brasil](https://www.atibrasil.com.br/).
🌱 I'm learning about React JS, React-Native and JavaScrip.
🎓👨‍🎓 Graduated in Information Technology Management.
📌 I live in Guaratuba - PR

Would you like to meet me?
